*You're right!* Remember we had ten potential articles of clothing that we were testing.

There you have it! You have built and trained your first neural network from scratch, and properly classified a boot as a boot!

Next Steps:

* Try using the model on a item of clothing outside the dataset (make sure to preprocess it first so it is on the same scale as the other images).
* Find another [image dataset](https://blog.cambridgespark.com/50-free-machine-learning-datasets-image-datasets-241852b03b49) to try this out on.
* Make an interface that responds with a label when you select a clothing image.
