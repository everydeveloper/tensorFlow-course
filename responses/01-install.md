## Install Python
As a first step, let's make sure Python is installed and running. To test if it is installed and configured already, type `python` into your terminal. If it isn't installed yet, it should say something like "python is a unknown command". If it is installed, it will open the python environment, and should look something like this:

```console
Python 3.6.7 (v3.6.7:6ec5cf24b7, Oct 20 2018, 13:35:33) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
If you see this type `exit()` to return to the command prompt. If not, you need install the latest Python 3 release for your OS: [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), [Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), [Linux/Unix](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/). After you install python, you need to add it to your PATH variable to use the `python` command shortcut. You can find directions for how to do this [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_environment.htm)

You will need to close and reopen you command prompt before the new environmental variable is recognized. Type `python` to check if it is set up correctly. You will also know that you are in the Python environment as the prompt at which you type is represented by ">>>".  Now, to install some packages for our project, we cannot do this from the Python environment, so we will need the means to leave the environment.  This command is conveniently `exit()`.
